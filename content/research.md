### Real Effects of Environmental Activist Investing
**[S. Lakshmi Naaraayanan](https://www.lakshmin.com/), [Kunal Sachdeva](/), [Varun Sharma](https://www.sharmav.com/)**

*Review of Financial Studies* (Conditionally Accepted)

![Environmental Activist Investing](/images/papers/environmental-activist.svg)

We examine how environmental activist investors drive firms to reduce their toxic releases, greenhouse-gas emissions, and cancer-causing pollution. Plants of targeted firms reduce their total toxic chemical releases by 13% on average through preventative efforts rather than end-of-pipe treatments. These improvements have real implications for local air quality and public health.

### Widespread Revisions of Self-Reported Emissions by Major US Corporations
**[Lauren Cohen](https://www.laurenhcohen.com/), [Ethan Rouen](https://www.ethanrouen.com/), [Kunal Sachdeva](/)**

*Nature Climate Change* (2025)

![Corporate Emissions Revisions](/images/papers/emissions-revisions.svg)

Examining 900 emissions disclosures from 276 of the largest U.S. corporations, we find that 60% of these disclosures are eventually restated. Firms are more likely to understate than overstate their emissions, with the value of understated emissions being more than twice the value of overstated emissions.

### Defunding Controversial Industries: Can Targeted Credit Rationing Choke Firms?
**[André F. Silva](https://sites.google.com/view/andrefjsilva/home), [Kunal Sachdeva](/), [Pablo Slutzky](https://pabloslutzky.com/), [Billy Xu](https://www.billyxu.com/)**

*Journal of Financial Economics* 172 (2025): 104133

![Defunding Industries](/images/papers/defunding.svg)

We examine Operation Choke Point, a regulatory initiative targeting bank relationships with certain industries. Affected firms fully compensate for lost credit access through non-targeted banks, with no changes in total debt or investment—highlighting challenges of using financial regulation to restrict specific industries.

### Skin or Skim? Inside Investment and Hedge Fund Performance
**[Arpit Gupta](http://arpitgupta.info), [Kunal Sachdeva](/)**

*Management Science* 71.4 (2025): 3357-3383

![Skin or Skim](/images/papers/skin-skim.svg)

Funds with greater inside investment outperform on a factor-adjusted basis. We attribute this to capacity constraints: insider funds are smaller and less likely to accept excess inflows, suggesting that managers with "skin in the game" prioritize performance over asset gathering.

### Inventor Gender and Patent Undercitation: Evidence from Causal Text Estimation
**[Yael Hochberg](http://yael-hochberg.com/), [Ali Kakhbod](http://www.akakhbod.com/), Peiyao Li, [Kunal Sachdeva](/)**

*R&R, Journal of Financial Economics* · NBER Working Paper No. 31592

![Patent Gender Gap](/images/papers/patent-gender.svg)

We document systematic undercitation of women inventors in the patent system. Using causal text estimation, we find that male equivalents of female-invented patents receive 12% more citations and are 16% more likely to become top-decile patents.

### Sustainability Meets Substance: Evaluating ESG Reports in Context of 10-Ks and Firm Performance
**[Ethan Rouen](https://www.ethanrouen.com/), [Kunal Sachdeva](/), [Aaron Yoon](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/yoon_aaron/)**

*R&R, The Accounting Review*

![ESG Reports](/images/papers/esg-substance.svg)

ESG reports contain financially material information unique from 10-K filings. This material information is associated with decreased downside firm risks, suggesting ESG reporting serves a meaningful informational role beyond signaling.

### Can Health State-Contingent Assets Enable Greater Survival Rates?
**[Kunal Sachdeva](/)**

*R&R, Review of Financial Studies*

![Health Contingent Assets](/images/papers/health-assets.svg)

Using the life settlement market as a natural experiment, I find that access to wealth in poor health states increases survival rates, with effects particularly pronounced for fragile individuals living far from hospitals.

### Opening the Brown Box: Production Responses to Environmental Regulation
**[Rebecca De Simone](https://www.rebeccadesimone.com/), [S. Lakshmi Naaraayanan](https://www.lakshmin.com/), [Kunal Sachdeva](/)**

![Brown Box](/images/papers/brown-box.svg)

Firms reduce pollution through strategic production choices: sourcing electricity externally and shifting toward higher-margin products. However, aggregate effects include reduced product variety and decreased business formation.

### Conflicting Objectives of ESG Funds: Evidence from Proxy Voting
**[Tao Li](https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/tao-li/), [S. Lakshmi Naaraayanan](https://www.lakshmin.com/), [Kunal Sachdeva](/)**

![ESG Proxy Voting](/images/papers/esg-proxy.svg)

ESG funds are more likely to vote against environmental and social proposals when the outcome is uncertain, suggesting they prioritize short-term returns over sustainability goals when the two conflict.

### Missing the Target? Retirement Expectations and Target-Date Funds
**[Byeong-Je An](https://sites.google.com/view/byeongje-an), [Kunal Sachdeva](/)**

![Target Date Funds](/images/papers/target-date.svg)

Survey evidence reveals that respondents underestimate their labor force participation by 4.8 years on average. This mismatch leads to a median 4% wealth loss at retirement due to suboptimal asset allocation.

![Bank Governance](/images/papers/bank-governance.svg)

Capital requirements have divergent effects on bank lending depending on the level of shareholder protection in bank management, highlighting the importance of considering governance in banking regulation.
