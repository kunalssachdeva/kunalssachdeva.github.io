            I am an [assistant professor of finance](https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/kunal-sachdeva) and Michael R. and Mary Kay Hallman Fellow at the [Stephen M. Ross School of Business](https://michiganross.umich.edu/), [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/).

            My research interests primarily focus on the real effects of financial markets on households and institutions. For more information, check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lBWscRoAAAAJ) and [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=2018424) pages.

            I earned a Ph.D. in Finance from [Columbia Business School](https://business.columbia.edu/). I previously graduated from [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/) with an M.Fin. and [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/) (Canada) with a B.A. and B.Sc. in Economic and Electrical Engineering, respectively. Before joining Ross, I was an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Jesse H. Jones School of Business, Rice University.
